Package: mpi-default-dev
Architecture: %SUPPORTED_ARCHITECTURES%
Section: libdevel
Depends: ${mpi-dev}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Standard MPI development files (metapackage)
 This metapackage depends on the development files of the recommended MPI
 implementation for each platform, currently Open MPI on all of the platforms
 where it exists, and MPICH on the others. The package which this depends on
 has alternatives links for the shared libraries libmpi and libmpi++, and for
 compilers mpicc, mpic++/mpicxx/mpiCC, mpif77 and mpi90 and their manpages.

Package: mpi-default-bin
Architecture: %SUPPORTED_ARCHITECTURES%
Section: net
Depends: ${mpi}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Standard MPI runtime programs (metapackage)
 This metapackage depends on the runtime programs of the recommended MPI
 implementation for each platform, currently Open MPI on all of the platforms
 where it exists, and MPICH on the others. The package which this depends on
 has alternatives links for mpirun and mpiexec.
